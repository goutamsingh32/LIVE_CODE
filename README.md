A real-time code editor built using Socket.io

# Socket instance

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

io.on(eventName, callbackFunction):
1. io: This represents the Socket.IO server instance you created earlier.
    (a) eventName: This is a string that specifies the event you're listening for. Common events include:
    (b) "connection": This event fires when a client connects to the server.
    (c) "disconnect": This event fires when a client disconnects from the server.
    (d) "message": This is a generic event for sending and receiving data between the server and client. You can customize this further based on your needs.

2. callbackFunction: This is the function that gets called when the specified event occurs. This function typically takes arguments that provide details about the event:
    (a) In the case of "connection", the argument might be the socket object representing the connected client.
    (b) In the case of "message", the argument might be the data (message) sent by the client.


# join and joined event

In Socket.IO, both join and joined are related to managing rooms for real-time communication, but they serve different purposes:

1. join(room):
    (a) This is a method called on the client-side socket object to join a specific room.
    (b) When a client calls socket.join(room), it tells the Socket.IO server that the client wants to be included in the communication happening within that room.
    (c) This allows the server to identify clients who are interested in receiving messages broadcasted to that room.
2. joined:
    (a) This is not a built-in event in Socket.IO. It's more of a concept or a custom event you might implement.
    (b) There's no server-side event specifically called joined. However, you can create a custom event to notify other clients in the same room that a new client has joined.

# socket.leave()
    When a client calls socket.leave(roomName), it sends a request to the server indicating that the client wants to be removed from the specified room.
    The server acknowledges the request and updates its internal list of clients associated with that room.
    From that point forward, the client will no longer receive messages broadcasted to the room it left using io.to(roomName).emit(...) on the server-side.
